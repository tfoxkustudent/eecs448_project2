Work:

Work was split between teammates based on skill-sets and volunteering.  Some people had explicit assignments, while others had more broad assignments, but as a whole everyone worked together effectively.  

Challenges:

The biggest challenge we encountered was the recursion.  The edge cases of the board proved the most difficult.  The way we dealt with these problems was typical.  Teammates consulted each other to see if someone knew how to fix said problem.  If not, we collectively worked on whatever it was keeping us stuck until we were able to move on.

Missed Features:

We did not have any features we wanted to add that missed the Demo

Retrospective:

If we could do it again, we would utilize github a little better.  Next time we will each have our own test branch and work through that rather than having our own forks and only the master branch.  We had a few confusing moments in terms of what was the most up-to-date code, but after a little consultation we managed to figure it out.
